# Blockchain developer roadmap
Welcome to the rabbit hole :) 
Rabbit hole is huge. New crypto innovations are countless!

## CEX


## De-Fi


## DAOs and Decentralized Governance

## BTC 

## BTC Layer 2 solutions
- Lightning Network
- [Liquid Network](https://liquid.net/)
- [Rootstock (RSK)](https://rootstock.io/) - The platform is also notable for its compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
- [Stacks Protocol](https://www.stacks.co/)

### Risks of Using Bitcoin Layer 2s
Notice: *Do not operate on L2s with large BTC amounts!*

For example, in 2022, Lightning users experienced a unique ‘[unattributed payment routing](https://protos.com/new-bitcoin-lightning-network-bug-unattributed-payment-routing/)’ failure due to a bug. They ended up interacting with faulty nodes as a result, without being aware of the problem for a long time.

Bitcoin Layer 2s can often be more centralized than the main network.



## NFTs
NFTs marketplaces operates as a blockchain-based aggregator marketplace designed for buying, selling and trading NFTs. 
It functions much like well-known e-commerce platforms such as eBay or Etsy but in a decentralized way.

List of some examples:
- [OpenSea.io - is the world's first and largest web3 marketplace for NFTs and crypto collectibles.](https://opensea.io/)

More than 83 Apps like OpenSea [https://www.alchemy.com/alternatives/opensea](https://www.alchemy.com/alternatives/opensea)

## Web 3.0

## Web  5.0
Web 5.0 combines the best of Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 

## Gaming

## AI

## RWA - Real World Assets


## What type of blockchain developer
In most cases you need to know most of them:
- Front-end
- Back-end and Smart Contract 
- FullStack
- QA
- protocol development/core developer 



## Select programming languages


### For Front-end

JavaScript, TypeScript, ReactJS, Next.js, Svelte or SvelteKit, HTMX, Nest.js, Vue.js etc.



### Rust vs Solidity

Learn Solidity
Do you want to work in the EVM ecosystem (
Ethereum L1, 
Arbitrum, 
Optimism, 
Polygon, 
Avalanche, 
BSC, Fantom, Polkadot Moonbeam, NEAR Auora, Cosmos EVMOS, etc)


Learn Rust
Do you want to work in the Rust-based ecosystem (Solana, NEAR, Ethereum StarkNet, Ethereum ZKSync, Ethereum Fuel, etc)


### Rust 
Invented - 2010
Blockchain - Polkadot, NEAR Protocol, And Solana
Influenced By - C/C++

Features:-
- We can add zero-cost abstraction without affecting the runtime of the code.
- Error Messages - These are displayed with (formatting, and colors) and also suggest misspellings in the program.
- Type Inference - It determines the type of an expression.

Advantages:
- It can be used to build decentralized applications with High Output.
- Its immutability allows the writing of predictable programs which are essential for blockchain-based applications.
- It emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency.

### Solidity 
Invented - 2014
Blockchain - Ethereum
Influenced By - C++, JavaScript and Python

Features:
- It is a statically typed contract-oriented language, influenced by C++, JavaScript and Python which runs on Ethereum Virtual Machine
- It supports obscure User-defined programming..

Advantages:
- It was the First smart contract programming language introduced and developed solely for smart contracts on the Ethereum network, so it has gained a wide range of community support
- If you are familiar with Python, C++, and JavaScript as many syntaxes were taken from these languages.
- It supports in mapping data structures which act as a hash tables and consist key value pairs.


### JavaScript


### Python

## Job websites

Question: Do you need a degree for this type of job? 
Answer: No. You need to have experience and code some projects and portfolio.

## Tutorials

Some advice before list with tutorials:

- Ask your self what is most visited website or app from you and search related tutorial that create clone of this website.
By this way you will learn all new thinks more quick and process will be more fun.

- Learn without rushing and try to remember the interrelationships and what works how and why.
