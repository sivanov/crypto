### Rust 
Invented - 2010
Blockchain - Polkadot, NEAR Protocol, And Solana
Influenced By - C/C++

Features:-
- We can add zero-cost abstraction without affecting the runtime of the code.
- Error Messages - These are displayed with (formatting, and colors) and also suggest misspellings in the program.
- Type Inference - It determines the type of an expression.

Advantages:
- It can be used to build decentralized applications with High Output.
- Its immutability allows the writing of predictable programs which are essential for blockchain-based applications.
- It emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency.

### Solidity 
Invented - 2014
Blockchain - Ethereum
Influenced By - C++, JavaScript and Python

Features:
- It is a statically typed contract-oriented language, influenced by C++, JavaScript and Python which runs on Ethereum Virtual Machine
- It supports obscure User-defined programming..

Advantages:
- It was the First smart contract programming language introduced and developed solely for smart contracts on the Ethereum network, so it has gained a wide range of community support
- If you are familiar with Python, C++, and JavaScript as many syntaxes were taken from these languages.
- It supports in mapping data structures which act as a hash tables and consist key value pairs.
