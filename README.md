## What is BTC (Bitcoin)?

Bitcoin (â‚¿) is a decentralized digital currency and digital store of value (SOV), without a central bank or single 
administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.

Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. 
The cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto.
The currency began use in 2009 when its implementation was released as open-source software.

Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, 
and services. Bitcoin has been criticized for its use in illegal transactions, the large amount of electricity 
(and thus carbon footprint) used by mining, price volatility, and thefts from exchanges. 

Some investors and economists have characterized it as a speculative bubble at various times. Others have used it as an 
investment, although several regulatory agencies have issued investor alerts about bitcoin. 

In September 2021, El Salvador officially adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, becoming the first nation to do so.

The word bitcoin was defined in a [white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) published on 31 October 2008.

## Why BTC is it so expensive?
BTC is limited to 21 million coins only.

**Notice**: In most centralized exchanges (CEX) like Coinbace/Biance/Kraken/Gemini/... you can buy BTC for minimum amount of $10 or more.
The market price is calculated by supply and demand. 

You must divide "Market Cap" by "Circulating Supply" and this will give you current price. 

Example: Market Cap	$863,535,393,452 / Circulating Supply 18,905,943 = $45 675,34
